# HKNS AI Application Template

A clean, modern, and scalable template for building full-stack AI application. Get all Hawkins components out the box.

## What's Inside?

This monorepo is a ready-to-use starting point and includes:

- `apps/web`: A Next.js application with two pre-built pages:
    - A **Profile** page with a sample form.
    - A **Dashboard** page with a clean empty state.
- `packages/ui`: A shared React component library, powered by Tailwind CSS. All your reusable components go here.
- `packages/utils`: Shared utility functions (like `cn` for class names).
- `packages/typescript-config`: Shared `tsconfig.json`s.
- `packages/eslint-config`: Shared ESLint configurations.
